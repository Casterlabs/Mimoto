# 身元 (Mimoto)

This repository contains Mimoto, the internal helper for all of the Casterlabs api.  
It:
 - Handles Authorization
 - Handles Accounts
 - Handles Ratelimits
 - Contains helpers for storing data on behalf of a user without needing to query the database yourself.
  
  
It's pretty well rounded, I'd say.
